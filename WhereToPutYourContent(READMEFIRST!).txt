Please adhere to the advised content structure.

Content/3D/Chars - for characters for example.

MAPS - Each full map should go into maps/<MapName>/ Folder, including all textures/assets/models/materials

So map 1 for our game is for example "DesertTown"

So,

Content/Map/DesertTown/ is the folder, and every bit of it is in that folder, including the umap file, materials, textures and models.

IF YOU ARE NOT SURE - Ask first. pls. we need to avoid our previous problems which were mostly files going everywhere except they were ment to :)

Cheers guys.
